# AI-Agents-Hybrid-Planning-for-Decision-Making
Building AI Agent from scratch - Decision Making and planning

## Bug Report

1) loop.py -> generate_plan is taking original input in each plan iteration, ideally in subsequent steps after first step it should be overrided_input which has more context


```python


# old code
plan = await generate_plan(
user_input=self.context.user_input,
perception=perception,
memory_items=self.context.memory.get_session_items(),
tool_descriptions=tool_descriptions,
prompt_path=prompt_path,
step_num=step + 1,
max_steps=max_steps,
)
# new code


plan = await generate_plan(
user_input=user_input_override or self.context.user_input,
perception=perception,
memory_items=self.context.memory.get_session_items(),
tool_descriptions=tool_descriptions,
prompt_path=prompt_path,
step_num=step + 1,
max_steps=max_steps,
)
```


2) in `mcp_server_2.py` in `process_documents` function there is no function exist `extract_webpage`
instead change to valid function `convert_webpage_url_into_markdown`


```python
# old code
markdown = extract_webpage(UrlInput(url=file.read_text().strip())).markdown


# new code
markdown = convert_webpage_url_into_markdown(UrlInput(url=file.read_text().strip())).markdown
```


3)
In many queries, when `Further Processing is Required`, it calls the same function repeatedly even though the content is already fetched and needs to act on the fetched content to get the final answer.
Added some rules for detecting when we already have content and an example as well.


`prompts/decision_prompt_conservative.txt`
```md
üîç DETECTION PATTERNS for already-fetched content:
- "Your last tool produced this result:"
- "Original user task:"
- Large blocks of markdown text
- HTML-like content
- Document excerpts with [Source: filename]
- Search results with numbered items



‚úÖ Example 6: HANDLING ALREADY-FETCHED CONTENT (CRITICAL)
```python
async def solve():
# User input contains: "Original user task: Summarize this page: https://theschoolof.ai/
# Your last tool produced this result: [WEBPAGE CONTENT HERE]"
# DO NOT call convert_webpage_url_into_markdown again!
# The content is already provided, just summarize it.
content = """[The webpage content from user input]"""
# Analyze and summarize the content directly
summary = f"The School of AI webpage discusses: {{content[:200]}}..."
return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{summary}}"
```

## New decision Prompt

```md
You are a reasoning-driven AI agent responsible for generating a simple, structured execution plan using ONLY the tools currently available to you.

üîß Tool Catalog:
{tool_descriptions}

üß† User Query:
"{user_input}"

üéØ Goal:
Write a valid async Python function named `solve()` that solves the user query using exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL.

üìè STRICT RULES:
- Plan exactly ONE FUNCTION_CALL only.
- must always define a function `async def solve():`
- Each tool call must follow the Usage docstring format exactly.
- MUST call only those tools that are available in Tool Catalog.
- Call a tool using its tool name string, not function variable.
  E.g., await mcp.call_tool('add', {{"input": {{"a": 1, "b": 2}}}})
  (NOT await mcp.call_tool(add, input) or await mcp.call_tool('add', input=...))
- Before each tool call, paste the full tool docstring enclosed in triple quotes (""").
- Call tool exactly as per its function signature: tool(input)
- If one FUNCTION_CALL depends on another, parse the previous result using json.loads(result.content[0].text)["result"] to extract  value from the tool's JSON output.
-‚ùóImportant: Never inline json.loads(...) inside f"" strings. Always assign it to a variable first (e.g., parsed = json.loads(...)["result"]) and use that in return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{parsed}}".
- End your function by returning a string that starts with 'FINAL_ANSWER: ' or 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED: '
- If  tool result is a document, webpage, or unstructured chunk, DO NOT return it as the FINAL_ANSWER.
- Instead, return it with 'FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED:' so the agent can interpret and summarize it next.

üîç DETECTION PATTERNS for already-fetched content:
    - "Your last tool produced this result:"
    - "Original user task:"
    - Large blocks of markdown text
    - HTML-like content
    - Document excerpts with [Source: filename]
    - Search results with numbered items
- If  user input already includes clean extracted webpage/document content, do NOT call the tool again. Summarize or generate  final answer from it.
```
