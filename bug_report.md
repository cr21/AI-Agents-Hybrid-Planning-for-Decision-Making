1) loop.py -> generate_plan is taking original input in each plan iteration, ideally in subsequent steps after first step it should be overrided_input which has more context


```python


# old code
plan = await generate_plan(
user_input=self.context.user_input,
perception=perception,
memory_items=self.context.memory.get_session_items(),
tool_descriptions=tool_descriptions,
prompt_path=prompt_path,
step_num=step + 1,
max_steps=max_steps,
)
# new code


plan = await generate_plan(
user_input=user_input_override or self.context.user_input,
perception=perception,
memory_items=self.context.memory.get_session_items(),
tool_descriptions=tool_descriptions,
prompt_path=prompt_path,
step_num=step + 1,
max_steps=max_steps,
)
```


2) in `mcp_server_2.py` in `process_documents` function there is no function exist `extract_webpage`
instead change to valid function `convert_webpage_url_into_markdown`


```python
# old code
markdown = extract_webpage(UrlInput(url=file.read_text().strip())).markdown


# new code
markdown = convert_webpage_url_into_markdown(UrlInput(url=file.read_text().strip())).markdown
```


3)
In many queries, when `Further Processing is Required`, it calls the same function repeatedly even though the content is already fetched and needs to act on the fetched content to get the final answer.
Added some rules for detecting when we already have content and an example as well.


`prompts/decision_prompt_conservative.txt`
```md
üîç DETECTION PATTERNS for already-fetched content:
- "Your last tool produced this result:"
- "Original user task:"
- Large blocks of markdown text
- HTML-like content
- Document excerpts with [Source: filename]
- Search results with numbered items



‚úÖ Example 6: HANDLING ALREADY-FETCHED CONTENT (CRITICAL)
```python
async def solve():
# User input contains: "Original user task: Summarize this page: https://theschoolof.ai/
# Your last tool produced this result: [WEBPAGE CONTENT HERE]"
# DO NOT call convert_webpage_url_into_markdown again!
# The content is already provided, just summarize it.
content = """[The webpage content from user input]"""
# Analyze and summarize the content directly
summary = f"The School of AI webpage discusses: {{content[:200]}}..."
return f"FINAL_ANSWER: {{summary}}"
```


```
